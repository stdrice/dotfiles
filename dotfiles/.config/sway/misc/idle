### Idle configuration
#
# Example configuration:
#
exec swayidle -w \
           before-sleep '~/.local/bin/lockscreen'
#           timeout 600 'swaymsg "output * power off"' resume 'swaymsg "output * power on"' \

# This will lock your screen after 300 seconds of inactivity, then turn off
# your displays after another 300 seconds, and turn your screens back on when
# resumed. It will also lock your screen before your computer goes to sleep.
